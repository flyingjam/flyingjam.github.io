    <h3> Spice and Wolf </h3>
    <img class="img-responsive novel-image" src="img/spice-wolf.gif" alt="">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        Holo is a powerful wolf deity who is celebrated and revered in the small town of Pasloe for blessing the annual harvest. Yet as years go by and the villagers become more self-sufficient, Holo, who stylizes herself as the "Wise Wolf of Yoitsu," has been reduced to a mere folk tale. When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at Pasloe, Holo offers to become his business partner if he eventually takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. The savvy trader recognizes Holo's unusual ability to evaluate a person's character and accepts her proposition. Now in the possession of both sharp business skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop. However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected.

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_and_Wolf">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Topping off the list is Spice and Wolf, and though the list is not ordered by quality, there is no doubt that this is one my favorites. It was licensed by Yen Press quite a while ago, and they've translated nearly the entire 17 novel series by now.</p>
<p>The novel features two main elements: drama and intrigue, often economically themed, and romance. Though no doubt the bizarreness of a medieval fantasy starring economics of all things is what initially attracted many to the series, what kept them was the romance. Unlike other works in this genre, both Lawrence and Holo are adults, and both are reasonably intelligent. The romance is slow but steady, growing at a far more realistic pace than in other light novels, where girls can fall for the main character after minutes of interaction. Though still a very innocent relationship as you'd expect in this genre, neither character is going to blush when holding hands.</p>
<p>The world of Spice and Wolf is great. Though medieval Europe is not exactly the most original setting, the novel does a much better job than other novels at presenting a sense of authenticity. There are no cafes here, no conveniently placed Japanese bathing areas, no delicious modern food. Life is hard, and people are grateful for small luxuries. What adds to this is the plot's relative subtlety. Lawrence and Holo, despite the former being an actual god, are no monsters of strength or intelligence, and the conflicts they get into are comparatively minor. Lawrence gets into debt, Holo mourns over her past; nothing Earth-shattering. Because of this, it's far easier to see the plot as just a microcosm of a much greater world.</p>
<p>The Yen Press translation is competent. Though the series is not amazing mechanically, it's more than good enough to convey the plot</p>
<p>Overall, the series is great, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone, especially those who like a more nuanced romance. It transcends the tropes that plagues other novels in the genre while emphasizing the tropes that make it click.</p>

    <h3> Book Girl </h3>
    <img class="img-responsive novel-image" src="img/book-girl.jpg" alt="">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        The protagonist of the story, Konoha Inoue, is a seemingly normal senior high 2nd year student. His high school life, other than a hinted incident 2 years ago, can be summed up as normal- if one can dismiss the secret fact that he used to be a female bestselling romance author. Due to that incident, however, he has now vowed never to write again. This continued on until he was forced to join the literary club by the literary club president, the 3rd year female student Amano Tooko, a beautiful girl who has a taste for eating literary works. Now he has been tasked with writing her snack every day after school.
    </span>
    <p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Girl">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>The description does an unfortunate job framing the story. The series is essentially a detective novel; Tooko plays the eccentric detective, while Inoue is her Watson. Each novel is themed by a particular literary work, usually classics, sometimes western but often Japanese. Unlike Sherlock Holmes, however, what the series is really about is character drama. And there is definitely a lot of drama. And unlike, say, Hyouka, the mysteries are fairly serious. You may begin to wonder at some point how the hell everyone near the main character is so batshit insane.</p>
<p>What really sets apart the novel, however, is the writing, and the better-than-normal translation from Yen Press. The author's colorful (and often very strange) analogies do a fantastic job at getting the drama-rich plot to stick at your heart.</p>
<p>Inoue, and just about everyone else in the novel, is hurt and traumatized. If you find it difficult to empathize with that kind of emotional trouble, you may not enjoy the novel. Do not expect a solid superman who always knows what to do. The characters here are weak and broken.</p>
<p>Romance wise, it's there, and builds slowly through the series, but the main mysteries of each novel take the spotlight.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it's a fantastic mystery series, and I'd recommend anyone able to pick up a copy.</p>

    <h3> Rakuin no Monshou </h3>
    <img class="img-responsive novel-image" src="img/rankuin.jpg" alt="">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        The countries of Mephius and Garbera have been waging a war for ten years and are trying to put an end to this long fight through a political marriage between the two royal families. Orba, who was driven from his home because of the war and was forced to become a gladiator, looks exactly like the crown prince of Mephius, and it has been decided he will be substituting him during the wedding ceremony. On the other hand, Vileena, the princess of Garbera, has secretly decided to ensnare the crown prince for her own country's interests.
    </span>
    <p>
        <p><a href="https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Rakuin_no_Monshou">Baka-Tsuki</a></p>
<p>Rankuin no Monshou is part political intrigue and part action, describing the schemes and machinations of the main character Orba. Orba is a smart and ruthless, and so is the world he exists in. His ability to extract victory from every situation is a <em>bit</em> far fetched, but still satisfying. Vileena's character is, unfortunately, mostly relegated to being &quot;strong willed&quot;. The novel was able to incorporate a darker, more morally gray tone while not simply seeming edgy, and for that it's a good fit for people who are looking for a more serious experience.</p>
<p>The plot is set in semi-medieval world, with some fantastical elements, like airships. The kingdom of Mephius that most of the plot</p>
<p>Just as a warning, Rankuin no Monshou <em>is dry</em>. If you don't like long winded descriptions of political planning, don't read the novel. Additionally, if you're here for the romance, well, it exist, but don't expect it to get anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>Translation wise, it's a fairly good fan translations. The sentences mostly flow together and there are little enough grammatical mistakes for you not to notice when reading.</p>
<p>I would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of political or war dramas and a strong, intelligent main character.</p>
